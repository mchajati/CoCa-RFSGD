CoCa-RFSGD (Coastal Catchment Regional Fresh Submarine Groundwater Discharge) is a Regional Hydrological Model to calculate fresh submarine groundwater discharge (FSGD).

File cocaRFSGD_momeva uses global mean values to calculate FSGD, which are stored in model_input/Coca.csv.
File cocaRFSGD_mc runs a Monte Carlo simulation of the model using the parameter uncertainties stored in model_input/Coca.csv to calculate the sensitivity of each parameter.
Information on the sources of and how the parameters in model_input/Coca.csv were calculated can be found in the publication: IN PROGRESS
